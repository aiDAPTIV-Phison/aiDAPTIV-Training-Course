## Step 3: Configure Host File 

### Windows
For Windows users, you‚Äôll need to update the host file to map the jump server address.  

1. Open the host file with admin privileges: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
2. Add this line at the bottom: 10.102.10.20 phisongenai.phison.com
3. Save and close the file.  

### macOS / Linux
For macOS and Linux users, the process is very similar.  

1. Open **Terminal** (use Spotlight Search with `Command + Space` and type ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù). 
2. Edit the hosts file with root privileges: 
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
You‚Äôll be prompted for your computer password.
3. Add this line at the bottom: 10.102.10.20 phisongenai.phison.com
4. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).
