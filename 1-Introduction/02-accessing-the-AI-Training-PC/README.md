## Step 3: Configure Host File (Windows Only)

For Windows users, you‚Äôll need to update the host file to map the jump server address.  

1. Open the host file with admin privileges: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
2. Add this line at the bottom: 10.102.10.20 phisongenai.phison.com
3. Save and close the file.  

*(Mac/Linux users do not need to update this step.)*
