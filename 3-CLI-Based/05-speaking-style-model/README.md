# Fine-Tuning a Celebrity Style LLM

**Why this matters:**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they often sound *generic*. By fine-tuning on specific text samples, we can shape a model’s **style, tone, and personality**. In this lesson, you’ll fine-tune an LLM so it responds in the **voice of a chosen celebrity**, demonstrating how style transfer works in practice.

## Lesson Overview

In this notebook, we will:  
- Collect and preprocess **celebrity-style text data**  
- Format the dataset for instruction fine-tuning  
- Launch a fine-tuning job using the OpenAI API  
- Evaluate how well the model captures the **celebrity’s voice**  
- Reflect on risks, ethics, and limitations  

---

## 1. Data Collection

- Choose a celebrity and gather sample text (interviews, speeches, posts).  
- Clean and normalize the text (remove HTML, noise).  
- Ensure compliance with **fair use** and **ethical guidelines**.  

---

## 2. Dataset Formatting

We will structure the dataset into **instruction-style training samples** where the model learns to generate responses in the celebrity’s voice.  

---

## 3. Fine-Tuning the Model

- Use the **OpenAI fine-tuning API**.  
- Upload the dataset as `.jsonl`.  
- Start a fine-tuning job and monitor progress.  

We’ll fine-tune a base model (e.g., GPT-3.5) with ~500–1,000 examples.  

---

## 4. Evaluating Outputs

After training:  
- Compare baseline vs. fine-tuned responses.  
- Check if the fine-tuned model captures **tone, vocabulary, and rhythm**.  
- Run **hallucination checks** to ensure factual accuracy isn’t degraded.  

---

## 5. Risks & Ethical Considerations

- **Misinformation**: A styled model may sound authoritative but spread incorrect facts.  
- **Impersonation**: Must disclose that this is a **synthetic voice**, not the real celebrity.  
- **Bias**: Celebrity data may contain harmful stereotypes.

## Review & Self Study

This lesson showed how to:  
- Collect and format **style-specific data**  
- Fine-tune an LLM for stylistic transfer  
- Evaluate results and consider risks

## Assignment

**Celebrity Style Demo** – fine-tune your own style model.  
- Pick a celebrity or public figure.  
- Collect ~50–100 text samples.  
- Format into instruction-output pairs.  
- Run a fine-tuning job.  
- Compare outputs before and after fine-tuning.
