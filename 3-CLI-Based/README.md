In these lessons, you will learn how to build and experiment with **command-line AI workflows**.  
Each project demonstrates a different aspect of working with Large Language Models (LLMs) using structured prompts, fine-tuning, and retrieval techniques — all from the CLI.  

These lessons build progressively from speaking style models, to multimodal function calling, instruction fine-tuning, evaluation, and retrieval-augmented dataset generation.

### Topics

1. [Speaking Style Model](04-speaking-style-model/README.md)  
   Learn how to adapt an LLM’s output style for different communication needs.

2. [Vision Function Calling](05-vision-function-calling-model/README.md)  
   Explore how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can analyze images and call structured functions.

3. [Instruction Fine-Tuning](06-instruction-fine-tuning/README.md)  
   Understand the basics of fine-tuning models on instruction–response datasets.

4. [LLM as a Judge](07-LLM-as-a-judge/README.md)  
   Use LLMs to evaluate outputs from other models with grading rubrics.

5. [RAFT Dataset Generation](08-RAFT-Dataset-Generation/README.md)  
   Learn how to generate datasets for Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT).
