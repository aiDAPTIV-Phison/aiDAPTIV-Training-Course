# Instruction Fine-Tuning

In this lesson you will learn how to prepare and validate datasets for **instruction fine-tuning**, a process that transforms a pre-trained large language model (LLM) into a **chat model** that can reliably follow user instructions. By carefully curating and structuring training data, we can make LLMs more responsive, accurate, and useful in real-world applications.

## What is Instruction Fine-Tuning?

Pre-trained LLMs are powerful at generating text but may not naturally follow instructions.  
**Instruction fine-tuning** is the process of refining these models with supervised datasets of **input–output pairs** so they learn to respond directly to user prompts.  

This process:  
- Improves **dialogue quality**.  
- Enhances **task performance** (translation, summarization, classification, etc.).  
- Aligns the model’s behavior with **real-world applications** like chatbots, customer support, and assistants.  

> ✅ Think of it as teaching the model how to *listen carefully* and respond the way you want, instead of just talking on its own.

## Lesson Overview

In this notebook, we will:  
- Introduce the concept of **instruction tuning**.  
- Explore dataset requirements and structures.  
- Validate dataset formatting and content.  
- Count tokens in the dataset to estimate training costs and time.  
- Visualize dataset statistics to ensure quality before training.

## Dataset Preparation

Instruction-tuning datasets typically cover tasks such as:  
- Translation  
- Text classification  
- Summarization  
- Question answering  
- Function calling  

Each dataset entry consists of:  
- **Instruction or question** (input).  
- **Expected answer** (output).  

For chat models, data can also include **roles** (`user`, `assistant`) and special tokens to structure the conversation.

## Data Validation

Before training, it’s critical to verify dataset quality.  
Validation steps include:  
1. Ensuring each entry is a dictionary with the correct keys.  
2. Confirming that required fields like `question` and `cot_answer` exist.  
3. Checking for unrecognized or extra keys.  
4. Verifying that all content fields contain text.  

By performing these checks, we can avoid training errors and wasted GPU hours.

## Token Counting & Statistics

Training cost and duration depend heavily on the total number of tokens.  
In this lesson we:  
- Use [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) to estimate dataset token counts.  
- Calculate approximate training time based on dataset size.  
- Visualize token length distribution across the dataset to spot outliers or inconsistencies.

## Assignment

**Instruction Tuning Dataset Demo** – build your own small dataset.  
- Pick a task (translation, summarization, classification, etc.).  
- Create at least 10 input–output pairs.  
- Run the validation, token counting, and statistics steps.  
- Reflect on how dataset size and structure affect fine-tuning.
