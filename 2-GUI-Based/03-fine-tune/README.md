# aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite - GUI Fine-Tuning Walkthrough

The **aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite** is a no-code, full-stack workflow platform that makes it easy to manage every stage of your local LLM projects from dataset preparation to deployment.  

This lesson shows you how to:
- Open and navigate the Pro Suite GUI  
- Generate a **dataset from a PDF** (automatic JSON Q&A pair creation)  
- Fine-tune a model with the generated dataset  
- Run **inference** on your fine-tuned model  

All of this is done entirely through the **Pro Suite GUI** no code required.

## 🧭 Suite Overview
Each tab in the Pro Suite corresponds to a stage of the AI workflow:

- **Dataset** → Prepare and manage your training data  
- **Finetune** → Fine-tune pretrained models with your custom datasets  
- **Monitor** → Track ongoing training jobs  
- **Validation** → Compare models side by side  
- **Inference** → Chat and test models interactively  
- **Models** → Manage model settings and versions  
- **Management** → Control user access and permissions  

---

## 📄 Dataset Tab
This is the **starting point** for all workflows.

- Upload new datasets and manage existing ones  
- Use **aiDAPTIVGuru**: a built-in tool that converts PDFs or plain text into structured **JSON Q&A pairs**, ready for fine-tuning  

---

## 💻 Finetune Tab
Where the fine-tuning happens.

- Fine-tune any supported pretrained model (e.g., **LLaMA**) using your dataset  
- Configure training parameters directly in the GUI  
- Launch and manage jobs without needing command-line steps  

---

## 📈 Monitor Tab
Real-time tracking for training progress.

- See live training status and active jobs  
- View **loss trend charts** to track convergence  
- Ensure your model is learning as expected before training completes  

---

## ⚖️ Validation Tab
Check if fine-tuning actually improved the model.

- Run **side-by-side model comparisons**  
- Ask test questions and see how different models respond  
- Get an immediate sense of performance improvements  

---

## 🔍 Inference Tab
Test your models in a **chatbot-style interface**.

- Select any model (base or fine-tuned)  
- Ask questions and interact with outputs in real-time  
- Useful for quick validation and demos  

---

## 💚 Models Tab
Your **model dashboard**.

- View all available models: base, fine-tuned, or uploaded  
- Adjust runtime parameters such as:  
  - **Max Token Length**  
  - **GPU Utilization**  
- Manage versions for easier switching between experiments  

---

## ⚙️ Management Tab
Admin and enterprise-level controls.

- Add or remove users  
- Assign roles and permissions  
- Secure your environment with access control  

---

## 🎯 Why Use Pro Suite?
With aiDAPTIV+ Pro Suite, you can complete the **entire fine-tuning workflow** without writing a single line of code:  

1. Generate training data from a PDF (auto-converted into JSON QA pairs)  
2. Fine-tune a model with your dataset  
3. Monitor progress and validate improvements  
4. Chat directly with your fine-tuned model  

This **no-code workflow** makes advanced model customization accessible to anyone - from researchers to enterprise teams.
