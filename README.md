# aiDAPTIV+ Training Course – Hands-On LLM Fine-Tuning

</div>

Learn how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) locally using **aiDAPTIV+** with both the **Pro Suite Graphical User Interface** and the **Command Line Interface**. This repository contains all lesson materials, datasets, code examples, and project files to learn aiDAPTIV+.

---

## 📚 About This Course
This hands-on curriculum is designed to teach you how to:
- Fine-tune LLMs on your own hardware or a provided remote AI Training PC (AITPC).
- Optimize GPU VRAM usage with **aiDAPTIVCache**.
- Use both GUI and CLI workflows for training and inference.
- Apply fine-tuning to real-world datasets such as company handbooks or public figure transcripts.

The course includes about **2 hours of recorded, follow-along video content**, but the full experience takes around **12 hours to complete**.  
Most of that time is spent running fine-tuning jobs, so you don’t need to stay at your computer while training is in progress.  

Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or student, you’ll gain practical skills to run on-prem AI cost-efficiently and securely.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

⚠️ **Step 1: Reserve Your AI Training PC (AITPC)**  
To take this course, you’ll need access to an AI Training PC.  
👉 [**Click here to request remote access**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1KLGisv-xU9KIc8ZPQBIBEfbS1VCW16qxCCXe-5_ZGfcgxg/viewform)  

*(Your request will be reviewed, and credentials will be sent to you once approved.)*

💻 **Step 2: Alternatively, use your own system**  
If you already have aiDAPTIV+ installed on your own hardware, you can skip the reservation form.  
👉 [**Installation instructions for aiDAPTIV+**](https://github.com/aiDAPTIV-Phison/aiDAPTIV/tree/56b10d68cb0f80163a799a1c1008554f9010dc7b/Page_Sections/Installation)  

✅ Once you have either remote or local access, you’re ready to begin the lessons.
