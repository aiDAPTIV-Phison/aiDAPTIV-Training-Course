# aiDAPTIV+ Training Course ‚Äì Hands-On LLM Fine-Tuning

Learn how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) locally using **aiDAPTIV+** with both the **Pro Suite Graphical User Interface** and the **Command Line Interface**. This repository contains all lesson materials, datasets, code examples, and project files to learn aiDAPTIV+.

---

## üìö About This Course
This hands-on curriculum is designed to teach you how to:
- Fine-tune LLMs on your own hardware or a provided remote AI Training PC (AITPC).
- Optimize GPU VRAM usage with **aiDAPTIVCache**.
- Use both GUI and CLI workflows for training and inference.
- Apply fine-tuning to real-world datasets such as company handbooks or public figure transcripts.

Whether you‚Äôre a developer, researcher, or student, you‚Äôll gain practical skills to run on-prem AI cost-efficiently and securely.
